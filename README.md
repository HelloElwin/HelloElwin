## About Me

Hi there, I am Elwin! 👋

🎈 I’m interested in:
- 🧠 Machine intelligence and abstract reasoning, especially studying the reasoning ability of deep-learning-based artificial intelligence.
- ❄️ Learning on graphs, e.g., graph neural networks, and their application in knowledge graph reasoning, recommender systems, etc.
- 🐷 Self-supervised learning, and how it can be applied to the upper-mentioned fields.

🧺 Other stuff:
- 🤖️ I’m currently a member of HKU Astar, a fantastic while lack-of-fund RoboMaster-AI team.
- 🎵 I love classical music, film music, harmony theory, and impromptu piano.
- 📸 I love photography & cinematography.
- 💬 Ask me anything! If you have the same interests as me, let’s be friends!
